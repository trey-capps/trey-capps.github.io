## Overview
Do you ever get tired of being recommended the same songs over and over again while on Spotify? If yes, Reddit is a great place to find new and upcoming artists as well as popular songs. This project seeks to provide a tool for users to explore certain music subreddits with hope to spot songs they may like. This tool will also provide the option for users to find which songs may be similar to playlist they currently have on Spotify. 

More to come when project is complete!
