I graduated from North Carolina State University in May 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and a minor in Mathematics. Apart from data, I enjoy hiking, music, and playing golf. 

To talk about data science, golf, or any other inquiries, feel free to message me on Linkedin or reach out through email.
